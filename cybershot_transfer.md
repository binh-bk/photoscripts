The model used is a DXC WX350.

1. problem 1
 * movies are recorded in the [M2TS format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.m2ts)

 * the file system's architecture is a "mess" (i. e. you need a proprietary
  software to access your data)
 * solution 2 = in fact, solution 1 fixes this as the "mess" was created by the
 AVHCD / MTS file format
